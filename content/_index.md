        Hi, I'm Richard, a Front-End Web Developer and Graphic Designer based in Toronto. I enjoy creating interactive websites and web apps written with clean, DRY code that are designed with pixel perfection.

        Currently, I'm a web developer at Kira Systems where I take ownership of all digital marketing assets including the corporate website, email marketing and blogs.

        Prior to taking the Web Development Immersive at HackerYou, I was a Marketing Design Lead at Jonas Club Software, where I collaborated with multiple departments to establish new ways to communicate with clients, develop relationships, reinforce brand image and drive sales revenue.

        When I'm not near a computer, I'm most likely out on an adventure with our ~~puppy~~ dog, Harley.
