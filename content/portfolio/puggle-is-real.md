A web app that assists dog owners who are busy with their day-to-day lives and are in search of trustworthy and responsible dog walkers in their area.

Built with React JS, members can register and join the online community as a 'dog walker' or as a 'dog owner'. Inputted data and media are stored into Firebase, where it is later called for display. Utilizing the Google Maps API, markers are added to pinpoint the locations of all members within the local vicinity of the user.
