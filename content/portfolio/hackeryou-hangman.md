An oldie but a goodie â€” your traditional Hangman game but with HackerYou staff names (and pups!)

After just a week of learning JavaScript, Matthew Parris and I collaborated and applied our existing knowledge of JavaScript _(arrays, math.randoms, splits, lengths, for-loops, appends, index-ofs, etc)_ to create this fun, interactive game.
