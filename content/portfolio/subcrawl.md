Had a long day at work? Need a drink on your commute ride home? How about eight?

This interactive web app uses JavaScript and jQuery to communicate with the Yelp API to grab the closest residing bars to every TTC subway station stop along your desired route, between your starting and final destination.

*_Please drink responsibly. Don't forget to buy a TTC day pass or use your Presto card, otherwise it'll be an expensive commute._
