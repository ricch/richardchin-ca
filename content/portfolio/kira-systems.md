[Kira Systems](https://kirasystems.com) is a powerful machine learning software that identifies, extracts, and analyzes text in contracts and other documents. As a Sr. Web Developer on the digital marketing and operations team at Kira, I helped create digital experiences for audiences ranging from law firms and corporations, to developers and regulatory bodies.

Collaborating with the marketing and creative teams, I was a key proponent in defining the marketing vision and roadmap. In addition to exploring technical solutions for projects, I helped lead the integration and maintenance of the tech stack, analytics, CRM and marketing technologies. Utilizing automations, recurring testing and continuous optimzation of the digital experiences, I was able to increase website traffic, boost conversion rates, create new opportunities, and drive revenue.
